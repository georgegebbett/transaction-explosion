# Transaction Explosion

##Look mom I'm getting ready to have a career!

At some point (hopefully) I'm going to have to have a crack at the Starling tech test. I have seen rumblings on Glassdoor that it involves rounding up some transactions, so I thought I'd do something fun and front-endy to practice.

The main goal here was to practice my CSS - I'm happy enough with the React and JS sides of this. I'm quite pleased with how it turned out because I really didn't want to use any libraries.
